# JavaOOPS Project-

# My Java code creates a Student object by prompting the user for details such as name, age, ID, address, contact, and email. It utilizes a Scanner object to capture user input. The Student class (not shown) likely stores these details and provides methods to access or modify them. Finally, the code prints the student's information using the toString() method. We can add other methods into it.
